#project 1 : This project demonstrates how to create a simple AI-powered storytelling generator using OpenAI's GPT-2 model. 
By inputting creative prompts, the model generates coherent and imaginative text continuations, making it ideal 
for short stories, plot generation, or brainstorming writing ideas.

Features
Utilizes the Hugging Face Transformers library.
Fine-tuned text generation using:
1 .GPT2Tokenizer
2. GPT2LMHeadModel

#project 2: 
This project showcases a question-answering system using a pre-trained BERT model. You provide a context and a question, and the model identifies the most probable answer span within the contex

Features

Based on the BERT large model fine-tuned on the SQuAD dataset.
Simple interface using Hugging Faceâ€™s pipeline() for QA.
Great for extractive question-answering tasks.
